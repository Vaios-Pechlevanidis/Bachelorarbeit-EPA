## 🧱 Cycle 2 – Increment 0 "Fundament"

Groundwork for anomaly detection and explanation (Design Science Research, cycle 2):

| Step | Where | How to run |
|---|---|---|
| Company metadata (ticker, ISIN, sector, peer group) | `backend/migrations/006_add_company_metadata.sql`, `backend/data/company_metadata.json` | Run the migration in the Supabase SQL editor, then `cd backend && uv run python scripts/seed_company_metadata.py` (dry-run) / `--apply` |
| Detection series (E3) | `backend/services/rating_series_service.py` | Input for anomaly detection in increment 1: `monthly_series(company_id, source, dimension)`, eligibility via `is_eligible` |
| Remove exact duplicates | `backend/scripts/remove_duplicates.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/remove_duplicates.py` (dry-run) / `--apply` — same key as the duplicate count in the data status (company, date, title, overall rating, status, free texts), keeps the lowest id per group; `--source`, `--company`; tests in `backend/tests/test_remove_duplicates.py` |
| Data density report | `backend/scripts/report_data_density.py` → `docs/datenbasis.md`, `backend/data/data_density.json` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/report_data_density.py` |
| Annotation basis (monthly series per company) | `backend/scripts/make_annotation_basis.py` → `backend/data/series/*.csv`, `backend/data/annotations.json` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/make_annotation_basis.py` |
| Annotation check | `backend/scripts/validate_annotations.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/validate_annotations.py` — `--file` checks another file with the same schema |
| Annotation comparison | `backend/scripts/compare_annotations.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/compare_annotations.py --b <file>` — agreement of two arbitrary annotation files with the E5 rule 6 assignment (±1 month, gaps up to 3 months, same direction, one-to-one): matching periods, only in A, only in B, share of series where both see no period; `--a`, `--b`, `--json`; tests in `backend/tests/test_compare_annotations.py` |
| Annotation sheet (DZ1) | `backend/scripts/make_annotation_sheet.py` → `backend/data/annotationsbogen.html` (git-ignored) | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/make_annotation_sheet.py` — standalone HTML from the series CSVs only (no detection code imported): one chart per eligible employee series, reviews per month, month table, protocol |
| Detection vs. reference periods (DZ1) | `backend/scripts/evaluate_detection.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/evaluate_detection.py --json data/calibration/dz1_ergebnis.json` — E5 rule 6 (±1 month, gaps up to 3 months, same direction, one-to-one); precision, recall, F1 per series, per source and overall, for level shifts alone and with outlier months; aborts while `annotations` is empty; `--file` takes another annotation file; `--subset alle\|ohne_duenne\|mehrmonatig\|mit_anker` (repeatable, default all four) reports the subsets fixed before the first run (E5, 2026-10-09) |
| News-source spike | `backend/scripts/spike_news_sources.py` → `docs/quellen-spike.md` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/spike_news_sources.py --company "Thyssenkrupp" --month 2023-04 --ticker TKA.DE` |

Reference periods in `backend/data/annotations.json` are entered manually by the author from the series CSVs (E5). Status 2026-10-03: the entries were deferred and the detection code of increment 1 now exists, so the order originally planned in E5 no longer applies. Replacement rule (E5): annotate before the evaluation, from the series CSVs and without looking at any detection results; this is recorded as a limitation for DZ1. Since 2026-10-08 the order is: generate the sheet, annotate, validate, commit the annotations alone, then run the evaluation (E5). Status 2026-10-09: 20 reference periods in 8 of 15 series, proposed by an agent from the series CSVs and reviewed and released by the author; version 2 replaced near-verbatim headlines in the notes by short descriptions; the four subsets of the evaluation are fixed before the first run (E5, update 2026-10-09). The evaluation ran once on 2026-10-10; the result is in `backend/data/calibration/dz1_ergebnis.json`, the origin of the reference periods in [docs/dz1-referenz/](docs/dz1-referenz/README.md).

## 🔎 Cycle 2 – Increment 1 "Anomalien im Verlauf"

Detects lasting level shifts in the monthly rating series and shows them in the dashboard. Method and parameters are recorded as preliminary in decision E9.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Change point detector | `backend/models/changepoint_detector.py` | PELT from `ruptures` (`model="l2"`, `min_size=3`, scaled penalty `2 · σ² · ln(n)` per series with robust `noise_sigma`; fixed `penalty` still selectable), moving-mean fallback for short series, `ChangePointDetector` protocol for further methods |
| Anomaly service | `backend/services/anomaly_service.py` | Uses `monthly_series` and `is_eligible` (E3/E4), detects on evaluated months only, filters `min_delta` (0.3 stars), sorts falls before rises; reviews before/after per change |
| API | `backend/routes/anomalies.py` | `GET /api/analytics/company/{company_id}/anomalies?source=employee&dimension=durchschnittsbewertung&penalty_factor=&penalty=&min_delta=` — `penalty_factor` (default 2) scales the penalty, `penalty` switches to a fixed value; returns series (period, mean, count, n_values, evaluated), anomalies (incl. segment bounds, gap before the marked month), parameters, eligibility; `dimension=all` returns eligibility and anomalies per dimension plus one combined list. Computed live, read-only, no migration |
| Dashboard card | `frontend/src/components/dashboard/AnomalyCard.jsx` | Below the chart row; chart as in the first version (monthly line, rings on the marked months), dashed interpolation over gaps, dimension picker, counter, eligibility notice; click opens the detail page, which shows the list, step markers (mean before → mean after), level line and full legend |
| Detail page | `frontend/src/pages/Anomalies.jsx`, route `/anomalies?company=ID&dimension=KEY&range=5y\|3y\|1y` | Since 2026-10-05 laid out like the stock dashboard: chart with a side card of markers (changes / outlier months), one-line drill-down bar, comparison and reviews side by side. Larger chart and list, dimension and company switcher, chart range from the first to the last evaluated month (hidden empty edges are named below the chart), time filter (view window counted back from the last evaluated month; detection always uses the full series), also reachable via "Anomalien" in the sidebar |
| Parameter overview | `backend/scripts/explore_anomaly_params.py` → `backend/data/calibration/` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/explore_anomaly_params.py` (read-only; evidence for checkpoint 1, not a calibration against reference periods) |
| Tests | `backend/tests/anomaly/` (detector, service, route; in-memory store, no network) | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/anomaly tests/forecast tests/test_rating_series_service.py -q` |

---

## 🔍 Cycle 2 – Increment 2 "Drill-down und Vorher-Nachher-Vergleich"

Select a change on the detail page to see the reviews of the periods before and after it and a comparison of what shifted in those reviews (topic shares, sentiment). The comparison describes changes in the reviews; it makes no statement about causes. Decisions E10–E13 (comparison windows and thresholds preliminary).

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Reviews of a period | `backend/services/review_service.py`, `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/reviews?source=&start=&end=&status=&offset=&limit=&format=full` | Dates inclusive, paginated read (more than 1000 rows), newest first, `total` = all matches; `format=full` returns `id`, `preview`, `fullReview` (format of the topic overview). Without the new parameters the response is unchanged |
| Keyword topics | `backend/services/keyword_topic_service.py` | Topic definitions per source and `analyze_topic` (moved from `routes/analytics.py`, output unchanged), `topics_in_review(row, source)`; `topic-overview` gains `end_date` |
| Comparison | `backend/services/explanation_service.py`, `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/anomalies/{anomaly_id}/explanations?source=&dimension=&status=&window_months=6` | Windows (E12), count and mean rating, share per topic and sentiment (overall and per topic), shift in percentage points, `low_basis`; one `SentimentAnalyzer` per process (transformer with star rating as hint, lexicon fallback), at most 300 newest reviews with text per window, cached per review id; `explanations` is empty until increment 5; unknown id → 404 |
| Reviewer group | `rating_series_service`, `anomaly_service`, `/anomalies?status=` | Status keys per source (`angestellt`, `ex-angestellt`, `eingestellt`, `abgelehnt`, …, `unbekannt`); detection, eligibility and penalty run per source, dimension and status (E13) |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/pages/Anomalies.jsx` (`?anomaly=&source=&status=`), `components/dashboard/AnomalyComparison.jsx`, `PeriodReviews.jsx`, `hooks/useReviewPages.js`, `useAnomalyComparison.js`, `lib/reviewerStatus.js` | Click a step or list row to select; sections "Vorher-Nachher-Vergleich" and "Bewertungen des Zeitraums" (25 per page, opens `ReviewDetailModal`); source toggle and status picker on card and detail page |
| Topic highlight | `/reviews?…&dimension=image&format=full[&topic_only=true]`, `components/dashboard/HighlightedText.jsx` | With a single dimension selected, keyword hits of its topic are marked in the review lists and the review modal, reviews mentioning it are tagged, a toggle shows only those (`?thema=nur`), and the comparison row of the topic is highlighted |
| Topics, topic filter and order in the review list | `/reviews?…&topic=<Thema>&order=asc\|desc`, `ReviewListControls`/`TopicTags` in `components/dashboard/PeriodReviews.jsx` | Every review carries its keyword topics (`topics`, shown as tags); `topic_summary` counts topics over the whole period; a select filters by topic (`?thema=<Thema>`, replaces the toggle, `?thema=nur` still works) and a toggle sorts by review date (`?sortierung=aelteste`) |
| Free drill-down (E17) | `period_windows`/`compare_period` in `backend/services/explanation_service.py`, `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/compare?from=&to=`, `components/dashboard/DrilldownPicker.jsx` | Click any month, drag a range in the chart or pick from/to (`?from=&to=`): reviews of the selection and a comparison with the equally long period before (at least 6 months), also for series without detected changes |
| Outlier months (E14) | `detect_outlier_months` in `backend/services/anomaly_service.py`, field `outlier_months` in `/anomalies` | Single months that differ from the medians of up to 3 evaluated months before and after by at least `max(3·σ, 0.5)` stars without forming a new level; shown as diamonds on card and detail page, list and reviews of the month (`?month=YYYY-MM`) |
| Tests | `backend/tests/drilldown/`, `backend/tests/anomaly/test_status_filter.py` (in-memory store, lexicon mode, no network) | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/anomaly tests/drilldown tests/forecast tests/test_rating_series_service.py -q` |

---

## 📈 Cycle 2 – Increment 3 "Aktienkurs und Kennzahlen"

The share price can run along the rating chart on a second y-axis: on the anomaly page via the toggle "Aktienkurs" (off by default, only for companies with a ticker) and in the stock dashboard together with a few company figures. Price and figures place the ratings in their market context; they are not an explanation. The dashboard neither claims nor computes any relation between price and ratings. Decision E15 (preliminary).

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Service | `backend/services/context_service.py` | Ticker from `companies.ticker`, fallback to `backend/data/company_metadata.json` when the column or value is missing (only if the name matches); monthly closes via yfinance (`period="max"`, `interval="1mo"`, adjusted for splits and dividends, running month dropped); market cap, employees, revenue per fiscal year; the network call sits behind `fetch_raw` and can be swapped |
| Cache | `backend/data/market/<ticker>.json` (in `.gitignore`, not committed) | Fields `ticker`, `ticker_name`, `currency`, `fetched_at`, `source`, `adjustment`, `prices`, `metrics`. Not refreshed automatically; rerun the script to update |
| Fill the cache | `backend/scripts/fetch_market_data.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/fetch_market_data.py` (all tickers), `--ticker SAP.DE` or `--company 19` (one). Reads the database, writes only files. `--summary` is read-only: it prints a Markdown table of the cache (first and last month, currency, `ticker_scope`, which figures exist with their as-of date; no prices or values), exit code 1 if a ticker has no price series |
| Runtime | `MARKET_LIVE_FETCH` (environment) | Cache first. Without a cache file the backend fetches once live and stores the result, unless `MARKET_LIVE_FETCH=0`. A failed fetch returns `available: false` with a reason (no 500) and is not retried for 15 minutes |
| API | `backend/routes/market.py` | `GET /api/analytics/company/{company_id}/market?start=YYYY-MM&end=YYYY-MM` → `company_id`, `ticker`, `ticker_scope` (`eigene Aktie` / `Konzernmutter` / `Konzerngesellschaft`), `ticker_name`, `currency`, `available`, `reason`, `prices`, `metrics`, `fetched_at`, `source`. Without a ticker: `available: false` with the reason from `peer_group`; unknown company 404; invalid period 400 |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/pages/Stock.jsx` (`?kurs=aus&verlauf=`), `frontend/src/pages/Anomalies.jsx` (`?kurs=an`), `components/dashboard/MarketContext.jsx`, `AnomalyChart` (prop `market`), `lib/market.js` | Shown in the stock dashboard (section "Kurs und Bewertungsverlauf", on by default) and, since 2026-10-05, on the anomaly page as an option: the toggle "Aktienkurs" in the header of "Monatsverlauf" appears only with a ticker, is off by default and loads `/market` only when switched on; markers, comparison windows, click and drag work as without price, and the link to the stock dashboard stays. Thin violet line on the right axis (currency in the axis label, legend, tooltip), only for the displayed months; figures with "aktuell, Stand …"; fixed note "Einordnung, keine Erklärung …"; parent company named explicitly (NTT DATA SE → NTT, Inc.). The dashboard card and the PDF export stay without price |
| Stock dashboard (E16) | `frontend/src/pages/Stock.jsx`, route `/aktie?company=ID&range=1y\|3y\|5y\|10y\|max&verlauf=5y\|3y\|1y&kurs=aus&periode=quartal`, `components/dashboard/FinanceCards.jsx` | Separate page ("Aktie" in the dashboard sidebar, link on the anomaly page): price chart, price over the monthly rating with detected changes (clicking a marker opens it on the anomaly page), analyst recommendations (last four months), revenue vs. net income (annual or quarterly), recent news. Price and figures cover FA-15; recommendations, revenue vs. net income and news (with their tiles) are extras outside the evaluated artifact and can be hidden with the build-time switch `VITE_SHOW_FINANCE_EXTRAS=false` (see Environment Variables); the page then calls `/market` instead of `/finance` and no `/news` |
| Finance API | `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/finance`, `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/news` | `/finance` = `/market` plus `analysts` and `earnings` (from the same cache; run the script again for caches from before E16). `/news` reads Google News RSS by company name (`backend/services/news_service.py`), cached 12 h under `backend/data/market/news/`; `fetch_market_data.py --news` fills it |
| Tests | `backend/tests/market/` (mocked fetcher, temporary cache directory, no network) | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/market -q` |

---

## 🧾 Cycle 2 – Increment 4 "Externe Belege im Ereignisfenster"

A piece of evidence is a message close in time with date, title, publisher and link. It is not a cause: the interface claims no relation to the ratings and does not rate any message. Decisions E7 (sources, measures of 2026-10-08), E18 (event window, evidence store), E19 (source types, reliability), E20 (general events).

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Event window | `backend/services/evidence_service.py` (`window_for_change`, `window_for_outlier`, `window_for_selection`) | Level shift: from 3 months before the start of the transition (month after `previous_period`, or `date` without a gap) to 1 month after `date`; outlier month and free selection: the same distances around the month or period. Both sizes are parameters, preliminary |
| Sources | `backend/services/evidence_sources.py` | Google News RSS as main source (one query per company and month with `after:`/`before:`, exclusion terms from `company_metadata.json`: `news_term`, `news_exclude`, `news_term_confirmed`; search terms of the 11 companies with markers confirmed by the author on 2026-10-08), EQS as second source for listed companies (UUIDs confirmed 2026-10-08), GDELT only behind `CONTEXT_GDELT=1` (off). Only title, publisher, link, date, source and language are kept; at least 2 s between requests of one source, the sources are fetched side by side (one thread each, lock per source); `source_type` news / adhoc / global (market reserved) with reliability mittel / hoch / Hypothese |
| Evidence store | `backend/data/context/<company_id>/<source>/<YYYY-MM>.json` (git-ignored) | Per company, source and calendar month, not per change; completed months are not fetched again, the current month after 12 hours; a changed search term invalidates a month; duplicates (same link or normalised title) count once |
| API | `backend/routes/context.py` | `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/anomalies/{anomaly_id}/context?source=&dimension=&status=&window_before=&window_after=&limit=&offset=` (also for an outlier month id `…:einzelmonat`) and `GET /api/analytics/company/{id}/context?from=&to=` → `anchor`, `window`, `items` (newest first, paged), `total`, `counts` per type, `sources` with state and errors, `coverage`, `reason`, `note`. Unknown change 404; no data an empty list with reason, never 500 for a failing source |
| Detail page | `frontend/src/components/dashboard/EvidenceSection.jsx`, `hooks/useEvidence.js`, `pages/Anomalies.jsx` | Section "Externe Belege im Ereignisfenster" under the comparison for the selected change, the selected outlier month and the free selection: window and counts per type in the header, per item date, title as link (new tab), publisher, type badge, EN badge; more on demand; fixed note. If the first page takes longer than 2 s, a line says that the months are fetched from the sources for the first time; the sources line names months fetched just now |
| Prefetch | `backend/scripts/fetch_context.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/fetch_context.py` fills the store for all level shifts and outlier months of the eligible companies (employees, overall rating), throttled and resumable; `--comparison` adds the comparison windows (see Comparison windows), `--from-month 2019-01` adds every month of a company from that month to the last rated month plus `window_after`; `--dry-run` only counts, `--source`, `--company`, `--max-fetches`, `--json`. After 3 consecutive errors of a source (e.g. HTTP 429 or 503) the run skips that source and names company and month to resume from. Reads the database, writes only files |
| Comparison windows | `backend/services/evidence_service.py` (`comparison_windows`) | For every marker up to three windows of the same company, the marker window shifted by −12, +12, −24, +24 months (checked in this order, same length and position to the anchor), dropped if it overlaps any marker window of the company or lies outside the rated series. Only a comparison of counts: no statement about causes |
| General events | `backend/services/macro_events.py` (cache `backend/data/macro/`, not versioned), `GET /api/analytics/global-events`, toggle "Allgemeine Ereignisse" on the detail page (`?ereignisse=an`, off by default) | Derived automatically since 2026-10-13 (E29) from Eurostat data for Germany: economic downturn (Economic Sentiment Indicator at least 10 points below its value three months earlier) and inflation surge (HICP rate at least 2 points above its value three months earlier and at least 5 %); refreshed weekly unless `CONTEXT_LIVE_FETCH=0`; replaces the hand-maintained `global_events.json` (E20). An event lasts at most 6 months. Events appear as evidence of type global (reliability Hypothese) and as dashed areas in the monthly chart, labelled "Allgemeines Ereignis, Hypothese"; they do not count as evidence in the coverage |
| Coverage (checkpoint 2) | `backend/scripts/report_context_coverage.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/report_context_coverage.py` reads only the store: per company the share of level shifts and outlier months with at least one piece of evidence (news or adhoc; global events listed separately), by type and by year of the marker (up to 2018, from 2019); `--comparison` adds marker against comparison windows (share with evidence, median and range of evidence per window; windows with missing months are listed, not counted as "no evidence"); numbers only, descriptive, no significance test (`--md`, `--json`) |
| Decision templates | `backend/scripts/report_context_decisions.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/report_context_decisions.py` reads store, metadata and database only: search terms with items per month and share of titles naming the company, EQS issuers, general events, prefetch proposal with fetches and estimated duration (`--from-month`, `--json`); no fetch, no titles |
| Issuer lookup | `backend/scripts/eqs_lookup.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/eqs_lookup.py "Bechtle"` prints the EQS issuers with companyUUID and ISIN for a name; the confirmed UUID goes into `company_metadata.json` (`eqs`) |
| Runtime | `CONTEXT_LIVE_FETCH` (environment) | `0` blocks every fetch; then only the store is used (see Environment Variables) |
| Tests | `backend/tests/evidence/` (window, store, routes, script; fake fetchers, temporary store, no network) | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/evidence -q` |

---

## 🧾 Cycle 2 – Increment 5 "Erklärungsansätze"

An explanation approach ("Erklärungsansatz") is a possible relation between a detected change and an externally documented event, based on correspondence in time and topic. It is never a cause; every entry shows what its stage rests on. Decisions E21 (signals, stages, bundling; iteration 2: stage rules version 2, labels, grouping by event category), E22 (event categories and topics), E23 (evaluation against comparison windows, addendum for version 2). Event categories and thresholds were confirmed by the author on 2026-10-08 and are frozen for the evaluation (`backend/tests/explanations/test_frozen_rules.py`); the stage rules are in their second version since iteration 2 (2026-10-08), the first version remains recorded as a dataset (commit 59f5d82).

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Distinctive terms | `backend/services/review_terms.py` | Words that the reviews of the window after (E12, free selection E17) mention clearly more often than the window before: at least 3 reviews and 3 % of the reviews after, share at least twice the share before; free texts and title only, without stop words, general review words and parts of the company name; none with a small basis (< 10 reviews in a window); at most 50. A title matches a term by equal word or word start from 6 characters |
| Event categories | `backend/data/event_categories.json`, `backend/services/event_categories.py` | Twelve employer-related categories (job cuts, leadership change, acquisition, collective bargaining and strike, site, pay, work model, litigation, employer award, crisis, hiring, culture) with German and English keywords (word starts, `*` for up to three words in between) and topics from E10, plus one group without employer relation (stock report, price target, sport, product, EQS capital market categories). The category with most hits wins; the group without employer relation only with more hits than every category |
| Ranking | `backend/services/explanation_ranking.py` | Per item three signals from 0 to 1: `term_match` (0.5 per term, 1 for a strong term), `category_match` (1 with a topic shift of at least 5 pp without small basis, 0.5 for the category alone), `time_match` (1 in the month before the transition and in the transition, decreasing to the edge, 0.5 after the marked month); `topic_match` = max of the first two (orders within a stage). Fixed stage rules, **version 2** (`RULES_VERSION`, author 2026-10-08): hoch (term ≥ 0.5 and category recognised and time ≥ 1), mittel (term ≥ 0.5 or category ≥ 1, and time ≥ 0.5), niedrig (category recognised or term ≥ 0.5, and time ≥ 0.3), otherwise keine; the group without employer relation one stage lower. Version 1 (hoch: topic ≥ 1 and time ≥ 1; mittel: topic ≥ 1 and time ≥ 0.5 or topic ≥ 0.5 and time ≥ 1; niedrig: topic ≥ 0.5 and time ≥ 0.3) is kept as a dataset in `test_frozen_rules.py`. Each stage carries a label that says what was found (`stage_label`, `rules.stage_labels`: "Wortbezug und Ereignisart", "Wortbezug oder Themenbezug", "nur Ereignisart"). Reports on the same event (same category, ≤ 3 days apart, title similarity ≥ 0.5) are bundled; sort by stage, then source type (only within a stage), signals, size, date; the top list holds at most one entry per event category (per term set without a category), the other bundles of the group under `group` (count, publishers, entries); at most five entries, otherwise state "offen". Grouping is display only: top stage per window, `n_by_stage` and `item_scores` are unchanged (tested). Title sentiment via the sentiment analyzer as a remark only. Text blocks never use Ursache, Auslöser, Grund, weil or führte (tested) |
| API | `backend/routes/anomalies.py` (`explanation_service.explanations_for`) | `GET …/anomalies/{id}/explanations` and `GET …/compare?from=&to=` now return `explanations` (≤ 5) and `explanation_summary` (state ansaetze/offen, window, sources, terms, `item_scores` per evidence item for the list, rules). Errors in this part give state offen with an error text, never a route error; one lock per month so that the evidence list and the explanations do not fetch the same month twice |
| Detail page | `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ExplanationPanel.jsx`, `EvidenceSection.jsx`, `hooks/useEvidence.js`, `pages/Anomalies.jsx` | Section "Mögliche Zusammenhänge" above the evidence list: stage badge with its label in one neutral colour (no traffic light; the key and the rule in the tooltip), reasoning in plain text, signal chips (term with counts, category with topic shift, time proximity, source type, title sentiment, hint when the title does not name the company), link, expandable bundled reports, expandable further entries of the same event category with count and publishers, state "offen", collapsible rules with the version and the sentence on the 2026-10-08 evaluation, fixed note "Die Einstufung beruht auf Titeln und Wortbezügen. Sie zeigt mögliche Zusammenhänge, keine Ursachen." The evidence list gets a sort toggle (Datum, Relevanz) and a filter by event category and shows stage (label) and category per item |
| Evaluation | `backend/scripts/report_explanation_validity.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/report_explanation_validity.py` computes the same ranking for every marker window and every comparison window of E18 (store only, no fetch, no title sentiment): share of windows with at least one approach per stage, top stage, medians, coverage rate after NFA-05 (`--json`, `--md`); numbers only, descriptive. Run once per version of the stage rules on 2026-10-08: version 1 (`backend/data/calibration/explanation_validity_2026-10-08.json`, commit 59f5d82): markers with an approach 23/28 (82 %) against comparison windows 58/76 (76 %), stage hoch 21 % against 21 %; version 2 (`explanation_validity_v2_2026-10-08.json`): 23/28 (82 %) against 58/76 (76 %), hoch 7 % against 4 %, mittel 32 % against 29 % — in both versions the ranking does not separate marker windows from comparison windows (E23). `--annotations` adds the same tables split by markers that hit a reference period (E5 rule 6) and the rest; reported as "nicht verfügbar" while the annotation file is empty |
| Tests | `backend/tests/explanations/` (constructed reviews and titles, mocked store, In-Memory-Store, no network) | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/explanations -q` |

## 🔦 Cycle 2 – Increment 6 "Transparenz und Demo"

Every figure names its definition, its data basis and its state. Decisions E24–E28 and the addendum to E21.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ø Score (D1, E26, FA-38) | `backend/services/score_service.py`, `GET /api/companies/{id}/ratings`, `frontend/src/lib/scoreText.js` | `score` = mean of the overall rating (`durchschnittsbewertung`) of all employee reviews in the selected period, unweighted, with `score_n`; `avg_overall` (mean of the 13 category means) unchanged and labelled "Kategorienmittel". Tile, detail window, comparison and PDF show `score` with n and the same calculation note |
| Trend of the overall rating | `GET …/ratings/trend?mode=score_months&months=12` | last 12 full months up to the last full month with reviews against the 12 before, n per window; the other modes are unchanged |
| Rolling averages (E24, FA-08) | `GET …/ratings/trend?mode=rolling`, tile "12- vs. 24-Monats-Schnitt" | 12 and 24 full months up to the anchor |
| Data status (E25, FA-37) | `GET /api/companies/{id}/data-status`, `DataStatusBar` | counts, period, eligibility, timestamps, cache and evidence store |
| Data basis and n (E27, FA-25, FA-26) | `frontend/src/lib/dataBasis.js` | tags Sternebewertung, Freitextanalyse, Externe Meldungen, Marktdaten; small-basis warning below 5 per month or 10 per window |
| Forecast switch (D2, E28) | `VITE_SHOW_FORECAST` in `frontend/src/config.js`, `frontend/Dockerfile` | `false` or `0`: no forecast in the timeline and the PDF; the evaluation instance is built with `false` |
| Quotes (NFA-07) | `backend/services/keyword_topic_service.py` (`QUOTE_EXCLUDED_FIELDS`) | topic quotes never come from `jobbeschreibung` or `stellenbeschreibung`; the topic calculation is unchanged |
| Signal labels (E21 addendum) | `backend/services/explanation_ranking.py` (`signal_label`) | badges name the present signals (Wortbezug, Ereignisart, Themenverschiebung, ohne Arbeitgeberbezug); stage key and rule in the tooltip |
| Acceptance check | `backend/scripts/check_evaluation_instance.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/check_evaluation_instance.py --api http://localhost:8000` — read-only check of environment, price cache and evidence store for all marker windows, sentiment mode and response times; exit code 1 on a gap |

---

## 🚩 Cycle 2 – "Eigene Ereignisse" (2026-10-17)

Dashboard users record their own events (management change, restructuring, site closure) per company; they appear as numbered marks in the anomalies chart of the detail page and in a third list "Eigene Ereignisse". No causal claim, no input to detection, explanations or evidence. Decision E32.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Table `user_events` | `backend/migrations/007_create_user_events.sql` | Run in the Supabase SQL editor (idempotent): month-exact `date_from`/`date_to` (`YYYY-MM`), `title` 1–120 chars, `note` ≤ 1000 chars, RLS as in migration 005. Until it is applied the routes answer 503 and name this file |
| Service | `backend/services/user_events_service.py` | input check with German messages (`normalize_event`), CRUD against the Supabase client or the in-memory store (whose `delete` now really removes rows) |
| API | `backend/routes/user_events.py` | `GET/POST /api/companies/{id}/events`, `PUT/DELETE /api/companies/{id}/events/{eventId}`; 400 on invalid input, 404 unknown company or event, 503 missing table |
| Detail page | `frontend/src/pages/Anomalies.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/dashboard/UserEvents.jsx`, `AnomalyCard.jsx` (`userEventShape`), `frontend/src/hooks/useUserEvents.js`, `frontend/src/lib/userEvents.js` | button "Ereignis eintragen" in the chart header, dialog with title / from / to (month grid) / note, purple numbered marks with a line at the start month and a tinted span, tooltip section, legend; tab "Eigene Ereignisse" (`?liste=ereignisse`) with edit and delete; click on mark or row selects the span (`?from=&to=`). Colour token `--user-event` in `index.css` |
| Tests | `backend/tests/test_user_events.py` | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/test_user_events.py -q` — input check, routes, company scoping, 404/503, in-memory delete, migration file |
| General events clickable and in the explanations (E29 addendum, 2026-10-17) | `frontend/src/components/dashboard/AnomalyCard.jsx` (`selectMonth`, `eventAreaShape`), `ExplanationPanel.jsx` (`GlobalEventList`), `backend/services/explanation_ranking.py` (`global_events_in_window`) | a click on a month inside a shown general-event area selects the whole event span (`?from=&to=`); `explanation_summary.global_events` lists the events of the window and the card "Mögliche Zusammenhänge" shows them as a hypothesis block with "Zeitraum wählen" and the Eurostat link; no stage, no rank, `n_items` and E23 unchanged (`tests/explanations/test_explanation_ranking.py::TestGlobalEventsInSummary`) |

---

## 📝 Cycle 2 – "Kurzbericht im PDF" (2026-10-17)

The PDF export opens with a rule-based summary on page 2 and ends with a page "Technische Hinweise". The summary names where the ratings stand out, not why; it computes no score and makes no statement about causes.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rules and texts | `frontend/src/lib/reportSummary.js` (`buildReportSummary`, `REPORT_RULES`) | Situation (Ø score with 95 % interval, trend, 12- vs. 24-month average), the 3 most recent changes with their stability, outlier months, strengths (topic with Ø ≥ 3.5 and no negative classification) and fields of action (negative classification or Ø < 2.5), at most 3 topics per column with at least 5 mentions, warnings on the data basis, limits of the data, up to 3 next steps phrased as questions for investigation, not as measures |
| Stability of a change | `stability_of_anomalies` in `backend/services/anomaly_service.py`, field `stability` in `/anomalies` | In how many parameter variants the change is found again (penalty factor 1–4, minimum segment length 2–6, minimum reviews per month 3–8; tolerance 3 months); computed when no fixed `penalty` is set |
| PDF pages | `frontend/src/utils/pdfExport.js` | Page 2 "Kurzbericht" (summary by fixed rules), last page "Technische Hinweise" (data status, calculation, thresholds, rules, labels) including the rules text of page 2 |
| Tests | `frontend/src/lib/__tests__/reportSummary.test.js` | `cd frontend && npm test` |

---

## 🧹 Cycle 2 – "Strenge Artikelauswahl" (2026-10-18)

Before bundling, explanation approaches use only reports that meet all four selection rules; the others stay in the evidence list together with the rule they do not meet. Decision E33; `strict=False` reproduces the previous selection (E23).

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Selection rules | `backend/services/explanation_ranking.py` (`STRICT_SELECTION`, `SELECTION_RULES`, `exclusion_reason`, `select_items`) | 1 the title names the company (a word of the name or the search term; general words such as "Deutsche" do not count; EQS releases of the issuer count as named), 2 employer relation (stock reports, price targets, sport and product news are excluded, not just ranked lower), 3 thematic correspondence: a distinctive term of the reviews in the title or text (the term itself or a word beginning with it) or a topic shift of the topic assigned to the event category; a recognised category alone is not enough, 4 time proximity at least 0.5 |
| API and detail page | `explanation_summary.selection`, `n_selected`, `n_excluded_by_reason`; `frontend/src/lib/explanationText.js`, `EvidenceSection.jsx` | The card "Mögliche Zusammenhänge" states how many items meet all four rules and how many were excluded per rule; the evidence list names the missed rule per item ("nicht in den Ansätzen: …") |
| Evaluation | `backend/scripts/report_explanation_validity.py` (`--no-strict` for the previous selection) | Run on 2026-10-18 (`backend/data/calibration/explanation_validity_strict_2026-10-18.md`): marker windows with an approach 14/28 (50 %) against comparison windows 23/72 (32 %); previous selection on 2026-10-13: 23/28 (82 %) against 57/72 (79 %) (`explanation_validity_korrektur_2026-10-13.md`) |
| Tests | `backend/tests/explanations/test_strict_selection.py` | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/explanations -q` |

---

## 🎯 Cycle 2 – "Dimension als globaler Filter" (2026-10-23)

With a single rating dimension selected on the detail page, the review list and the evidence list show only what belongs to that dimension; "Gesamtbewertung" shows everything again. Decision E34.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Membership rule | `backend/services/dimension_scope.py` | A review belongs to the dimension if it has a comment on this category or names a keyword of its topic; the stars alone are not enough. A piece of evidence belongs if its title (or its text, see "Text der Berichte") names a keyword of the topic or its event category is assigned to the topic; general events drop out |
| API | `GET …/reviews?…&dimension=<key>&dimension_only=true`, `GET …/anomalies/{id}/context?…&dimension=&dimension_only=true`, `GET …/context?from=&to=&dimension=&dimension_only=true` | Counts `n_dimension` of `n_all`; `dimension_only` needs a single dimension, not the overall rating (400 otherwise) |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/lib/dimensionScope.js`, `hooks/useReviewPages.js`, `hooks/useEvidence.js`, `pages/Anomalies.jsx` | Note above the lists, "n von m" counts, the reason per evidence item ("Bezug zur Dimension: …"), a button back to the overall rating |
| Drill-down from the comparison | `drillToTopic` in `frontend/src/pages/Anomalies.jsx`, `components/dashboard/AnomalyComparison.jsx` | A click on a topic row of the before/after comparison switches the page to the matching dimension and opens the reviews of the window before or after; topics without a dimension filter the review list by topic |
| Tests | `backend/tests/drilldown/test_dimension_scope.py`, `frontend/src/lib/__tests__/dimensionScope.test.js` | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/drilldown -q` |

---

## 📰 Cycle 2 – "Text der Berichte" (2026-10-23)

For EQS releases and news items the text of the report is fetched once and stored. Term matching and the dimension filter then look at the text as well as the title. The text itself is not shown in the interface; items with a text carry the note "Text geprüft". Decision E35.

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Text store | `backend/services/evidence_text.py`, `backend/data/context_text/<company_id>/<item>.json` (git-ignored) | Main text of the page (paragraphs, list items, headings), status `ok`, `kurz` (under 300 characters) or `fehlgeschlagen`; Google News links are resolved to the publisher's page; at least 1 s between requests to a publisher and 2 s for Google |
| Fill the store | `backend/scripts/fetch_evidence_text.py` | `cd backend && uv run python scripts/fetch_evidence_text.py --eqs` (all stored EQS releases), `--news` (candidates among the news items of the marker windows), `--news --comparison` (also the comparison windows); `--dry-run`, `--company`, `--max-fetches`, `--retry-failed`, `--json` |
| Use | `explanation_ranking.py` (`term_match` in title or text, chip "im Text"), `dimension_scope.py`, `explanation_service.py` | Terms that occur in too many texts of a window are not counted in the text and are named in the card. Switch `EXPLANATION_TEXTS` (default on; `0` uses the titles only) |
| Evaluation | `backend/scripts/report_explanation_validity.py` (`--no-text`) | Run on 2026-10-25: with texts, marker windows with an approach 16/28 (57 %) against comparison windows 42/72 (58 %) (`explanation_validity_text_2026-10-25.md`); control without texts 14/28 (50 %) against 23/72 (32 %) (`explanation_validity_kontrolle_ohne_text_2026-10-25.md`). With texts the comparison windows gain more than the marker windows |
| Tests | `backend/tests/evidence/test_evidence_text.py`, `test_fetch_evidence_text_script.py`, `backend/tests/explanations/test_text_match.py` | `cd backend && uv run python -m pytest tests/evidence tests/explanations -q` |

## 📦 Installation Guide

A detailed step-by-step guide for setting up the project can be found in **[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)**.

It covers:
- Prerequisites & Software Installation
- Backend & Frontend Setup (with `uv` and `pip`)
- Configuring Environment Variables
- Verifying the Installation
- Common Problems & Solutions

## 🚀 Setup

### Backend (FastAPI)

If `uv` is installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
```

Then select the `.venv` folder as the Python Interpreter for the project.

**Alternative without uv:** If you prefer classic `pip`:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The backend server can be started as follows:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

or with classic Python:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Backend runs at:** `http://localhost:8000`  
**API Documentation:** `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI)

### Frontend (React + Vite)

If `node` is installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Then start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Frontend runs at:** `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

Copy the template and fill in the Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | — | URL of the Supabase project |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | — | service_role key, used for write operations (bypasses RLS) |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | — | anon/public key, fallback when `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is not set |
| `MARKET_LIVE_FETCH` | on | `0` blocks live fetches of share prices and figures; only the cache under `backend/data/market/` is used |
| `CONTEXT_LIVE_FETCH` | on | `0` blocks every fetch of external evidence (Google News RSS, EQS); the context routes and `fetch_context.py` then use only the evidence store under `backend/data/context/`. Set it on the interview day after prefetching (decision E7, 2026-10-08) |
| `CONTEXT_GDELT` | off | `1` adds GDELT DOC as a third source of evidence; off by default (rate limit, mostly English) |
| `EXPLANATION_TEXTS` | on | `0` (or `false`) ignores the stored report texts; term matching and the dimension filter then use the titles only |

Without `SUPABASE_URL` and a key the backend starts with an in-memory store and three synthetic companies (Demo 1–3) instead of the database.

**Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository!

### Frontend (`VITE_*`)

The frontend reads `VITE_*` variables when Vite starts or builds (shell environment, `frontend/.env.local`, the hosting environment, or Docker build arguments). `frontend/.env.production` sets `VITE_API_URL` to the hosted backend, so `npm run build` targets it unless `VITE_API_URL` is set.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Backend URL (`/api` is appended) |
| `VITE_SHOW_FORECAST` | on | `false` (or `0`) hides the forecast of the timeline (Holt, cycle 1) in the dashboard and the PDF export: the timeline requests `forecast_months=0`, shows no forecast line, separator, legend entry or "Ø Prognose", and the PDF cover names only the period of the data. Decision D2 of 2026-10-09: the evaluation instance is built with `false` (E28) |
| `VITE_SHOW_FINANCE_EXTRAS` | on | `false` (or `0`) hides the extras of the stock dashboard: the cards analyst recommendations, revenue and net income, recent news and the tiles net income and analysts. The page then shows the price (with and without rating history), the figures of FA-15 (market cap, employees, revenue) and the fixed note, and does not call `/finance` or `/news`. Meant for hiding the extras in the evaluation instance (decision E16). Decision D3 of 2026-10-08: the evaluation instance for the interviews is built with `false` |
| `VITE_SHOW_OUTLIER_MONTHS` | on | `false` (or `0`) hides the outlier months completely; otherwise they carry the note "ungeprüft" in legend and tooltip |

```bash
# Frontend without the stock dashboard extras
cd frontend
VITE_SHOW_FINANCE_EXTRAS=false npm run build
# Docker
docker compose build --build-arg VITE_SHOW_FINANCE_EXTRAS=false frontend
```

## 💡 Tips

* It's best to have **2 terminal sessions** open to run backend and frontend simultaneously!
* Make sure the `.env` file in the backend folder is correctly configured
* For a production build of the frontend: `npm run build`
* Clear cache: `find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +`
* Delete old models: `cd backend/models/saved_models && rm -f lda_model_*.* 2>/dev/null`

### Performance Tips (Version 2.1):
* **Dashboard loading slowly?** → Hard-Reload (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)
* **Check API calls**: Browser DevTools → Network Tab → Filter "Fetch/XHR"
* **Analyze re-renders**: React DevTools → Profiler Tab
* **Caching enabled**: CompanySearchSelect automatically caches after first load

### Topic Detail Modal Features:
* **Collapsible view controls:** Click "Customize View" to show/hide elements
* **Smart layout:** Charts automatically expand when others are hidden
* **5 customizable sections:**
  - ✅ Statistics (Frequency, Rating, Sentiment)
  - ✅ Timeline Chart (Rating over time)
  - ✅ Sentiment Chart (Gauge with percentage display)
  - ✅ Typical Statements (Top 3 Statements)
  - ✅ Sample Review (with navigation)
* **Time Filter:** Choose between All Time, 1 Year, 6 Months, 3 Months, or 1 Month
* **Review Navigation:** Click on statements to see the full review

```

### Data Sources

**Candidates Table:**
- `stellenbeschreibung`
- `verbesserungsvorschlaege`

**Employee Table:**
- `jobbeschreibung`
- `gut_am_arbeitgeber_finde_ich`
- `schlecht_am_arbeitgeber_finde_ich`
- `verbesserungsvorschlaege`

### Example Usage

#### Python (Topic-Rating Analysis):
```python
import requests

# Train model
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/topics/train",
    json={"source": "employee", "num_topics": 5}
)
print(response.json())

# Analyze employee reviews with sentiment & ratings
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/topics/analyze/employee-reviews-with-ratings",
    params={"limit": 50}
)
analysis = response.json()['analysis']

# Get topic-rating correlation
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/topics/analyze/topic-rating-correlation"
)
correlation = response.json()['correlation']

for topic in correlation['topics']:
    print(f"Topic {topic['topic_id']}: "
          f"{topic['avg_rating']:.1f}⭐ "
          f"({topic['mention_count']} mentions)")
```

#### cURL:
```bash
# Analyze topics with ratings
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/topics/analyze/topic-rating-correlation"

# Analyze text
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/topics/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "The work-life balance is excellent!", "threshold": 0.1}'
```

### Technical Details

- **LDA Algorithm**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Gensim
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Lexicon-based with 100+ German sentiment words
  - Recognizes intensifiers (sehr, extrem, total)
  - Considers negations (nicht, kein, nie)
  - Calculates polarity (-1 to +1) and subjectivity (0 to 1)
- **Preprocessing**: Lowercase, stopword removal, token filtering
- **Language**: Optimized for German texts
- **Parameters**: Configurable topics (2–20), passes, iterations
- **Storage**: Automatic saving of trained models
- **Integration**: Combines topics, sentiment, and star ratings

## 🚨 Common Problems & Solutions

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Port 8000 is in use
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Missing dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Reinstall specific packages (if necessary)
npm install @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-label
```

### Dashboard loading slowly (Version 2.1 should fix this!)
```bash
# 1. Hard-Reload in browser
# Chrome/Edge: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)
# Firefox: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)

# 2. Clear browser cache
# DevTools → Application → Clear Storage

# 3. Check Network Tab
# DevTools → Network → Check if KPI calls run in parallel
# Should now be ~50% faster!
```

### "Model not trained" Error
```bash
# Train a model first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/topics/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "employee", "num_topics": 5}'
```

### Python Cache Issues
```bash
# Delete all __pycache__ directories
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
```

### Delete old models
```bash
# Free up disk space
cd backend/models/saved_models
rm -f lda_model_*.* 2>/dev/null
```

### Running only some tests
```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest -q                       # All backend tests
uv run pytest tests/anomaly/           # Anomaly detection only
uv run pytest tests/topic_modeling/    # Topic modeling only
uv run pytest tests/sentiment_analysis/ # Sentiment only
```
